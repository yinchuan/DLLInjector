A simple dynamic-link library(dll) injector. The code is mainly from [Hacking a game with DLL injection [Game Hacking 101]](https://youtu.be/KCtLiBnlpk4). A feature is added to read process name and dll path from command line arguments.

Usage:
```
Usage: DLLInjector.exe <processName> <dllPath>
```
